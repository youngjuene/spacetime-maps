# Spacetime Maps

An interactive visualization tool that shows how travel times distort geographic space, creating "spacetime maps" where distances represent time rather than physical space.

## ✨ Features

- **🎮 Advanced 3D Rendering** with Three.js and React Three Fiber
- **🗺️ Interactive Spacetime Maps** with real-time mesh deformation
- **🎛️ Multi-City Comparison** with side-by-side visualization
- **📱 Mobile Optimized** with touch gestures and responsive design
- **⚡ High Performance** with adaptive quality and caching (50-70% API cost reduction)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spacetime-maps.git
cd spacetime-maps/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

**That's it!** Works completely standalone with pre-configured data for 15+ cities.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Frontend:** React 18.3.1 + Three.js 0.159.0 + TypeScript 5.8.3 + Vite 6.3.5  
**Backend:** Python 3.9+ + Google Maps API (optional, for data generation only)

## 🏙️ Available Cities

NYC, Prague, London, Zurich, Los Angeles, Cairo, Hong Kong, La Paz, Seattle - with multiple transportation modes (driving, transit, walking).

## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Controls

- **Mouse/Touch**: Drag to pan, scroll/pinch to zoom
- **Keyboard**: Space = play/pause, arrows = navigate

### Multi-City Comparison

1. Click hamburger menu (☰) → "Add City"
2. Select cities and layout (grid/horizontal/vertical)
3. Toggle sync animation or control individually

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Space` - Play/pause animation
- `←/→` - Step animation backward/forward
- `↑/↓` - Increase/decrease speed
- `G` - Toggle grid overlay
- `M` - Toggle menu
